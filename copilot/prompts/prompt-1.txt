Me:
Create a Python code that includes the steps below, where the script will do the following:

- plot the current vs time
- name of script file to create: plot.py
- the dataset.txt file has a dataset in time-series format
- the dataset.txt file is a csv file with 4 fields: timestamp, time (in seconds), raw current (A), current (A)
- the script will use the fields: 1, 2 (if necessary), and 4
- the script will open the dataset.txt file
- use the command line to accept two arguments to define the data range: "initial data", "final data"
- the script will read data with the mentioned fields starting at "initial data" until the "final data"
- plot the current in y-axis and time in x-axis.
- using the read data, plot the graphic of current vs time, where the idea is to see how the current vary with the time
- write X and Y labels, where X = Time and Y = Current

Copilot:
Here is the Python code that performs the requested operations:
This script reads the dataset.csv file line by line, checks if the timestamp is within the specified range, 
and if so, it adds the time and current data to their respective lists. It then plots the current vs time and 
labels the axes. The script accepts two command line arguments for the initial and final data.
The timestamps in the file and the command line arguments are assumed to be in the format "HH:MM:SS dd/mm/yy".
