Create a Python code that includes the steps below, where the script will do the following:

- the script will open the dataset.txt file
- the dataset file located at '.\\project\\sample_data\\dataset.txt'.
- save the created script in a file named 'plot.py'
- the dataset.txt file is time-series dataset with a csv format
- the dataset.txt file has 4 fields: timestamp, time (in seconds), raw current (A), current (A)
- the script will use the fields: 1, 2 (if necessary), and 4
- use the command line to accept two arguments to define the data range: "initial data", "final data"
- the script will read data with the mentioned fields starting at "initial data" until the "final data"
- to create the plot, use the range "12:16:09 17/05/24", "14:54:01 17/05/24"
- plot the current vs time. Plot the current in y-axis and time in x-axis.
- using the read data, plot the graphic of current vs time, where the idea is to see how the current vary with the time
- write X and Y labels, where X = Time (S) and Y = Current (A)
- make sure the x-axis follow the '%H:%M:%S' format
